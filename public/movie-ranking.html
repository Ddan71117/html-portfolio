<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Wayne's World</h3>
<p>This movie is a cult classic and it's jokes are timeless and very quotable.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Though outdated by todays standards, this movie was arguably considered<br /> revolution in filmography where special affects are conserned as well as an<br /> original Sci-fi story.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>The abstract plot line that eventually came together in the end made this<br /> movie brilliant. The dark humor and vulgarity was also memorable and quotable.</p>
